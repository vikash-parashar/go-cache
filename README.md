# Caching with Go, Redis, Docker, and Third-Party API

In this project, we will demonstrate how to build a simple caching mechanism using Go programming language, Redis as a cache store, and Docker for containerization. We will also fetch data from a third-party API and cache the responses for improved performance.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Go: https://golang.org/
- Docker: https://www.docker.com/
- Redis: https://redis.io/
- A text editor or IDE of your choice

## Project Setup

1. Create a new Go project directory:

```bash
mkdir go-cache
cd go-cache

Initialize a Go module:
